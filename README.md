# JSON

It could be better having the dictionary structures converted to json, since it would allow some fancier techniques.

# string.translate()

It could also be good to use the `replace` method for making the conversion of strings less intensive and messy with the loops.
But this would probably add some difficulties to work with the numeric systems of each script, particularly those that employ different digits for tens, hundreds etc.
So far, the string.translate() will be better employed in scripts that use simpler numeric notation.
